# Coursera + IBM: Applied Data Science Project on SpaceX Data
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey as I delve into the realm of data science. I learned how to perform webscraping, data wrangling, explanatory data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and presenting the findings.

Most of the file-contents are provided by the Coursera. These files are provided in the last course "Applied Data Science Capstone" from the "Applied Data Science" specialization, by the IBM on the Coursera. These notebooks and python file contain my solutions to the assignments. The aim is to get, analyze, visualize, build a machine learning model, and a dashboard with the SpaceX data on rocket lauches. 

There are additional files which are used within the code files.
- `my_data1.db` is for `2A. jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`
- `spacex_launch_geo.csv` is for `3. lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb`
- `spacex_launch_dash.csv` is for `spacex_dash_app.py`

It may be required to install additional libraries and packages to run all code files.
