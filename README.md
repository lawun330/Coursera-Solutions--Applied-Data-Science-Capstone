# Coursera - IBM - Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project-on-SpaceX
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey as I delve into the realm of data science. I learned how to perform webscraping, data wrangling, explanatory data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and presenting the findings.

Most of the file-contents are provided by the Coursera. These files are the assignments of a final capstone of the "Applied Data Science" course provided by the IBM on the Coursera. These notebooks and python files contain solutions.
